# Printed Circuit Board for 6502 Computer Development

Copyright 2021 Jason Schlachet


## Circuit

This was a personal project to gain experience designing a PCB and having it
manufactured.

I started with Ben Eater's 6502 breadboard schematic and transcribed it into EasyEDA.
Then I made some personal modifications, and then designed a PCB for it. I manually
routed the VCC net, and then moved components around until auto-routing produced a 
reasonable result.

This board has been produced at JLCPCB and successfully ran a Hello World application.
